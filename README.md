What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:

Prepare and share your project for collaboration
Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
Organize an event
Mentor others
Donate directly to open source projects

How Does it Work?

-Quality pull requests submitted on GitHub and GitLab are rewarded.

Details

The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.
